# gornl
Simple Journal webapp writting in go, similar to jrnl

This is not a production quality app. 

---------------------
That said, gornl is a simple webapp for keeping a daily journal. It stores data in simple text files. The format is similar to that of https://github.com/maebert/jrnl, with facilities added for having a password on the journal.

--------------------
Put the binary somewhere, create a "journals" directory, and `touch` a journal.txt. Then navigate to localhost/journal/journal to start recording memories. KISS!
