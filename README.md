# gornl
##Simple Journaling Webapp


This is not a production quality app. 
It was written to help me learn go, and to fulfill a personal need, but feel free to help out/fork/etc if it is interesting to you.

---------------------
## Description
That said, gornl is a webapp for keeping a daily journal. It stores data in simple text files. The format is similar to that of https://github.com/maebert/jrnl, with facilities added for having a password on the journal.

--------------------
## Use
Put the binary somewhere, create a "journals" directory, and `touch` a journal.txt. Then navigate to localhost/journal/journal to start recording memories. KISS!
