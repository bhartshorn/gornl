# gornl
Simple Journal webapp writting in go, similar to jrnl

This is not a production quality app. Needs configuration sutff and more cleaned out. Needs authentication.

---------------------
That said, gornl is a simple webapp for keeping a daily journal. It stores data in simple text files. The format is identical to that of https://github.com/maebert/jrnl

--------------------
Put the binary somewhere, create a "journals" directory, and /touch/ a journal.txt. Then navigate to localhost/journal/journal to start recording memories. KISS!
